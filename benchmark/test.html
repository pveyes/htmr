<p>This weekend I was working on my side project to list and display all my future tech talks. This is an overengineered
  web app built using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">CRA</a> and <a
    href="http://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle">Spectacle</a>, with a little bit of React Router (I'll write
  about it in another post). I want to be able to display talk information in both inside app and in GitHub (where I
  host the repository), so I decided to put talk title and description in <code>README.md</code> inside talk directory
  to prevent duplication.</p>
<h2>preval.macro</h2>
<p>My original solution to this problem was using <code>preval.macro</code> which uses <code>babel-plugin-macro</code>.
  Using preval is straightforward. Preval allows me to write JS code with filesystem access that will be executed on
  build step (via babel). It's really cool, you should try it yourself.</p>
<p>Basically you just import the macro, use it via <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">tagged template</a>, and
  put the code you want to execute as string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import preval from &#x26;#39;preval.macro&#x26;#39;;

const markdown = preval`
  const fs = require(&#x26;#39;fs&#x26;#39;);
  const path = require(&#x26;#39;path&#x26;#39;);
  module.exports = fs.readFileSync(
    path.resolve(__dirname, &#x26;#39;./README.md&#x26;#39;),
    { encoding: &#x26;#39;utf-8&#x26;#39; }
  );
`;
</code></pre>
<p>This works but I don't like the boilerplate of requiring <code>fs</code> and <code>path</code>. It's also not
  reusable because I can't just pass file path.</p>
<h2>raw-loader</h2>
<p>Then I remember about <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> <a
    href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader"><code>raw-loader</code></a>. CRA uses webpack under the hood,
  so <code>raw-loader</code> should work. Unfortunately CRA <a
    href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2961">doesn't yet have a solution</a> regarding importing
  raw text file. I know this is unsupported method, but maybe still worth trying.</p>
<p>First I need to install <code>raw-loader</code> as <code>devDependencies</code> because CRA doesn't include it by
  default, then I need to use webpack loader require syntax because CRA doesn't allow me to extends webpack (for good
  reason). The result is slightly better than preval (in term of boilerplate).</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const markdown = require(&#x26;#39;raw-loader!./README.md&#x26;#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>This fails the build of course, because CRA enable eslint rule to disallow webpack loader syntax. I need to disable
  it via eslint comment. Not pretty.</p>
<p>Then I had another use case for importing code example to spectacle code slide. This is where it gets weird. Somehow,
  importing it using raw-loader causes some newlines to be removed unintentionally. This is really frustrating because I
  need to annotate the exact line number to highlight some parts of code. This inconsistencies of removing newlines
  means I need to know the line number AFTER it was removed. Not pretty.</p>
<p>Then I was thinking of creating my own <code>babel-plugin-macros</code> to replace <code>preval</code> and
  <code>raw-loader.</code> I searched it first, but no luck.</p>
<p>It's time for another side project.</p>
<h2>raw.macro</h2>
<p>This is the first time I write macro using <code>babel-plugin-macros</code>, so I didn't have a clue what to do. I do
  know AST a little, but still. Fortunately I have a lot of inspirations from <a
    href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds">Kent C. Dodds</a>. He has a lot of repositories using babel macro. (of course,
  he was the author of <code>babel-plugin-macros</code>).</p>
<p>I saw <code>preval.macro</code> codebase and learn basic macro creation, but the functionality is quite different, so
  not much to copy/paste (sorry Kent). Then I saw <code>import-all.macro</code> codebase and it's pretty similar to what
  I want to achieve. A function accepting arguments that gets compiled to another thing.</p>
<p>First step of creating macros are making sure all references in codebase get replaced.
  <code>babel-plugin-macros</code> provides <code>createMacro</code> function that accept function with some parameters:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { createMacro } from &#x26;#39;babel-plugin-macros&#x26;#39;;

export default createMacro(rawMacro);

function createMacro({ references, state, babel }) {
  // do something
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our function will be given one argument (it's an object) that includes <code>references</code>, <code>state</code>,
  and <code>babel</code>. We use <code>references</code> to perform AST transform for all macro references in the
  codebase. <code>state</code> provides us with information regarding current processed file (we mostly interested with
  its filename, more on that later), and finally <code>babel</code> is mostly used to create new AST via <a
    href="https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-types">babel-types</a> available as
  <code>babel.types</code> (people usually rename it to <code>t</code>).</p>
<h3>API requirement</h3>
<p>We want to create macro like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import raw from &#x26;#39;raw.macro&#x26;#39;;

const md = raw(&#x26;#39;./README.md&#x26;#39;);
</code></pre>
<p>That will be converted to this (depends on <code>README.md</code> content):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const md = &#x26;#39;# Title\ndescription&#x26;#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>So we know that the only valid usage is function call (or <code>CallExpression</code> in the AST). First we need to
  process all references</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function rawMacro({ references, state, babel }) {
  references.default.forEach(referencePath =&#x26;gt; {
    if (referencePath.parentPath.type === &#x26;#39;CallExpression&#x26;#39;) {
      processReference({ referencePath, state, babel });
    } else {
      throw new Error(&#x26;#39;Invalid usage&#x26;#39;);
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to get function arguments We only need one because the function only accepts one argument. We also need
  to make sure that the file path is deterministic (not a variable where we need to know the value).</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function processReference({ referencePath, state, babel }) {
  let relativePath;
  try {
    relativePath = referencePath.parentPath.get(&#x26;#39;arguments&#x26;#39;)[0].evaluate()
      .value;
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error(&#x26;#39;Value is not deterministic&#x26;#39;);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Reading file contents</h3>
<p>After getting function argument, we need to resolve its absolute path. This is where filename from <code>state</code>
  comes in handy. We can get directory of the filename using <code>path</code>, and merge the path with the relative
  path from previous step. We can use full path to get file contents via <code>fs</code>. We need to use sync method
  because macro needs to be resolved synchronously.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import path from &#x26;#39;path&#x26;#39;;
import fs from &#x26;#39;fs&#x26;#39;;

function processReference({ referencePath, state, babel }) {
  const dirname = path.dirname(state.file.opts.filename);
  const fullPath = path.resolve(dirname, relativePath);
  const content = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, { encoding: &#x26;#39;utf-8&#x26;#39; });
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Replacing AST</h3>
<p>The last step is replace original AST. We'll use babel.types to create new AST. What we replace is the function call,
  with an expression containing string literal. We use <code>replaceWith</code> method on AST node that we want to
  replace.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function processReference({ referencePath, state, babel }) {
  const t = babel.types;
  referencePath.parentPath.replaceWith(
    t.expressionStatement(t.stringLiteral(content))
  );
});
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. We only need a few lines of code to replicate webpack <code>raw-loader</code> functionality.</p>
<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
<p>Finally we need to add some tests to make sure that our macro works as expected. The easiest way to unit test macro
  is by using <code>babel-plugin-tester</code> with snapshot enabled. We provides some code, and
  <code>babel-plugin-tester</code> will write a new snapshot containing our code and our transpiled code. You should
  learn about <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html">Snapshot Testing</a> if you
  haven't already. It's really cool, useful, and will probably saves you a lot of time testing something.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const pluginTester = require(&#x26;#39;babel-plugin-tester&#x26;#39;);
const plugin = require(&#x26;#39;babel-plugin-macros&#x26;#39;);
const prettier = require(&#x26;#39;prettier&#x26;#39;);

pluginTester({
  plugin,
  snapshot: true,
  babelOptions: {
    filename: __filename,
  },
  formatResult(result) {
    return prettier.format(result, { trailingComma: &#x26;#39;es5&#x26;#39; });
  },
  tests: {
    &#x26;#39;correct usage&#x26;#39;: `
      import raw from &#x26;#39;../macro&#x26;#39;;
      const md = raw(&#x26;#39;./fixtures/markdown.md&#x26;#39;);
    `,
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>It will create this snapshot:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP

exports[`macros correct usage: correct usage 1`] = `
&#x26;quot;
import raw from &#x26;#39;../macro&#x26;#39;;

const md = raw(&#x26;#39;./fixtures/markdown.md&#x26;#39;);

      ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

const md = \\&#x26;quot;# Title\\\\n\\\\nThis is the description\\\\n\\&#x26;quot;;
&#x26;quot;
`;
</code></pre>
<p>As you see in the snapshot, the macro works as expected.</p>
<p>You can see end result in my repository: <a

<hr>
<p>I was really amazed on how much we can do with babel, especially with babel macros. The possibilities are endless. I
  think I'm going to write another babel macro soon.</p>
